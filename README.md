Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a field of engineering that focuses on design,testing and evaluation of software and systems that make computers funtion. 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Writing instructions (code) for computers
Building apps, games, and websites that makes our lives easier.
Solving real-world problem through technology.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Learn the basics
Build small projects
Work on real-world projects


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methologies are for developing mission-critical systems like an air traffic control system where thorough documentation and a clear, unchanging set of requirements are essential.
Whereas Agile methologies create a social media platform where user feedback and iterative improvements are crucial for success.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-Design and write code.
Quality assurance- Tests and fix bugs
Project manager- Collaborate with a team to create amazing stuff


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
VS Code where we write code and Git it keeps track of all changes


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
New tools,Languages and frameworks are emerging regurlarly. Stragegies can be continuous learning and community involvement


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Test and fix bugs

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and crafting input prompts to effectively communicate with AI models, especially those based on natural language processing (NLP). The goal of prompt engineering is to elicit the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses from the AI model by carefully constructing the input prompt.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about the weather
Tell me what is the current weather in Gauteng, South Africa and what are the forecasts for the next three days?
